# 4995 Industries Presents: Whiteboard

## What is it?

"Whiteboard" is a real-time collaborative whiteboard application developed by CS 4995 students at the University of Minnesota-Duluth.

## Setup

1. Download and set up the [NodeJS whiteboard server](https://github.umn.edu/umdcs4995/nodejs)
2. Change the values in app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml to match your server address
    - Change "hostname" to your server hostname
    - Change rtc_port to your RTC signalling port (3001 by default)
    - If your server is NOT running over HTTPS (most people):
        - Change "secure" to false
        - Change "port" to your server port (3000 by default)
    - Otherwise, if you ARE running over HTTPS:
        - Change "secure_port" to your HTTPS port
3. Build and run the Android application (we use Android Studio)

## Nodejs Development Information

The server is written in Javascript using [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org), and most of the client-server communication uses [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/). This means that most of the communication is *asynchronous*, so you need to write your code in a way that can be executed asynchronously without problems. There are good examples of this in JoinBoardFragment.java.

### Building messages

Message data needs to be packaged in a JSONObject or JSONArray in order to be sent via socketio. This is pretty easy to do:

    JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject();
    jsonData.put("name", "testBoard");

Sometimes it helps to think about JSONObjects is as HashMap<String,Object> and JSONArrays as List<Object> (though technically speaking, this isn't totally correct).

### Sending and receiving a message

In order to send or receive a message, your class needs to have access to the global SocketService. You can access this through the Globals singleton:

    final SocketService socket = Globals.getInstance().getSocketService();

Sending a message can be done through the sendMessage method, which takes a string and either a string, JSONObject, or JSONArray. Message types are stored in a "struct" called Messages within SocketService.

    socket.sendMessage(SocketService.Messages.CREATE_WHITEBOARD, jsonData);

SendMessage will throw an error if it does not have a connection to the server, so make sure to check for that.

To receive a message, you need to set up a listener, which is usually an anonymous function that will get called when the server send s message back with the given message type (such as createWhiteboard).

For example, to set up a listener to for a createWhiteboard message,

    socket.addListener(SocketService.Messages.CREATE_WHITEBOARD, new Emitter.Listener() {
        @Override
        public void call(Object... args) {
            
            // args[0] is a string containing the server's response, which we parse into a JSONObject
            JSONObject recvd = (JSONObject) args[0];
            
            try {
                Log.i("createWhiteboard", "received message: " + recvd.getString("message"));
            } catch (JSONException e) {
                Log.e("createWhiteboard", "error parsing received message");
            }
            
            // After we have successfully processed the response, 
            // remove the listener so it doesn't get called again.
            socket.clearListener(SocketService.Messages.CREATE_WHITEBOARD);
        }
    });

### Debugging messages

You can see a live log of the public server at https://lempo.d.umn.edu:4995/log.html

Additionally, you can simulate a real client and test sending messages at https://lempo.d.umn.edu:4995/console.html

### Server message types

|       Name       |       Purpose         | Arguments | Returns |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| createWhiteboard | Creates a whiteboard. | name | A success or error message |
| joinWhiteboard   | Joins a whiteboard.   | name | A success or error message |
| deleteWhiteboard | Deleted a whiteboard. | name | A success or error message |
| me               | Allows user to get information about themselves | none | A JSONObject with 'whiteboard' property containing user's current whiteboard |
| chat message     | Blast a message to all users | message | The message |
| drawevent        | Sends a drawevent to users in the current whiteboard | drawevent object generated by DrawProtocol | none |

### Getting Google to Work
Before Google Sign in you need to run, you will need to authenticate your client with their services. 
To do this, you will first need to add your SSAH ID to our google-services.json file:
1. Go to terminal and enter this command to obtain your SSAH 
keytool -exportcert -list -v \
-alias <your-key-name> -keystore <path-to-production-keystore>
Copy this code down, you will need it!

2. Open the Credentials page https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials?pli=1

Follow these steps if your application needs to submit authorized requests:

Click Add credentials > OAuth 2.0 client ID.

Select Android.
In the Package name field, enter your Android app's package name.
Paste the SHA1 fingerprint into the form where requested.
Click Create.
Otherwise, follow the steps below, which are for applications that only need to make unauthorized API calls:

Click Add credentials > API key.
Select Android key.
Paste the SHA1 fingerprint into the form where requested.
Type your Android app's package name into the form where requested.
Click Create.
